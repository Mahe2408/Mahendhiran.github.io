        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-container">
            <p>Hi! I’m Mahendhiran, a third-year BTech Computer Science student at Hindustan University.
                 I have a passion for technology, coding, and developing projects that solve real-world problems. 
                 Recently, I’ve been working on projects like gold rate prediction systems and movie ticket booking websites, which have allowed me to hone my skills in web development and data analysis.
                <br><br>
                Beyond academics, I am an artist at heart and enjoy photography and drawing, which I see as a way to bring creativity into my tech projects.
                 I also keep active through strength training and sports – I’ve even represented my school in a national Kabaddi event. Currently, I’m focused on building my portfolio, expanding my technical skills, and working toward a career in the tech industry.
                <br><br>
                If you’re interested in collaboration or want to know more about my projects, feel free to reach out!</p>
